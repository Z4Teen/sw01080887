      "I bought an iPhone 14 through Shopee official store on 25/07/2023. I received it the next day on 26/07/2023. After a few hours of using it (mind you it was not more than 5 hours), my phone suddenly went blank and was unable to turn on. I literally have no idea why it happened because I was putting my phone back after using it, and by the time I wanted to open my phone, it couldn't be on. \n",
      "\n",
      "I contacted the agent from @switch_os and was asked to bring the device to the nearest switch center for further checking. The day after that, I went to switch at The Mines and after being diagnosed, they told me that the reason for it was the failure of the motherboard. I asked for a new replacement and they said that I am not eligible for it because I purchased it online. They informed me that I need to wait 7-10 WORKING DAYS just to get my phone fixed!!!! Now, I need to wait for that nonsense period just to get my own phone fixed because of that failure of the motherboard. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was disappointed with the overall experience of purchasing an iPhone at Switch and wouldn't recommend any of my families or friends to buy any devices here!!!!! I mean, other people would get so mad if the phone you bought and used for not more than a day went broken just because of the motherboard!!!\n",
